Team Norms
  
When a teammate is expected to be absent, they will notify the rest of the team before their absence to see what they can do while they are gone. The team will delegate tasks the absent members cannot perform to each other. 

When a teammate has an unexpected absence, they text the rest of the team to ask if they can do anything while they are gone.

If teammates disagree, they will discuss their concerns with respect. We will use tools like decision matrices, and if things are getting extremely cutthroat, the two teammates in the argument will spend time separated. Teammates not involved in the argument will act as a neutral party and diffuse the situation.

Each team member will be assigned a task. This task must be completed by its deadline, but exceptional circumstances may allow it to be completed past the deadline. 

To help teammates improve their weaknesses, they will be expected to observe, assist, and ask questions about the task the other teammate is working on.

To conduct ourselves professionally and respectfully, each teammate will be expected to treat everyone they interact with with respect while representing Henley Robotics.

Time Commitment: 
As a robotics team, we know we must have a time commitment. We plan to reserve a minimum of 3.5 hours a week in school for developing the robot, a minimum of 2.5 hours outside of school with exceptional circumstances, allowing less for short periods, and a goal of at least six hours a week. We plan to meet during our Robotics II class period from 11:08-11:59 on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 11:25-12:12 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and from 10:41-11:23 on Fridays but aim to meet outside of these times on weekends/no school days to develop the robot. 

Mentorship:
By being on team 3017D, members commit to conducting themselves in the highest manner and to provide inspiration and mentorship to younger members of Henley Robotics, our base club. As we mentor these kids in the Elementary School Robotics Program, we plan to pass down our knowledge and experiences to help these young kids acquire the knowledge that we have gained throughout our years of robotics. This aims to build up the robotics program and give more opportunities to the lower classmen.  

Additionally, we mentor each other by teaching our unique notebooking, coding, 3D design, sketching, organizational skills, and general experience with the excellent engineering design process. This is done to strengthen ourselves and our team and prepare us for future endeavors outside of high school robotics. 

Decision-Making Framework:
Our general decision-making process is as follows: First, the problem is identified. Then, the problem is independently researched, and solutions are presented to the entire group during a meeting. During this meeting, they will be evaluated in a decision matrix and verbal discussion. Following this, we will vote as a group on the best solution initially presented and modify it as necessary so that the highest possible number of team members agree it's the best solution.

Main roles:

__*Coders*__ — Our main coder is Theron. Aleia and Hunter learn alongside Theron how to code more complex code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) when Theron cannot attend meetings. 

__*Builders*__ — Layne, Aleia, and Ethan will help each other build the robot exactly as the CAD has been done unless they cannot copy the CAD due to functional issues. They will tweak the robot designs after they have been completed and fix any minor issues that appear. 

__*Documentor*__ - Aleia is the head notebook, with Theron training to become the co-notebook lead. They will coordinate notebook entries with team members, correct formatting, and document meeting notes in the notebook. 

__*Scouter*__—Hunter and Aleia will oversee scouting. Aleia will do pre-competition scouting, and Hunter will do scouting at the competition by observing all matches played at said competition.
